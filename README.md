# Surfs_Up

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to present to W. Avy's and his board of directors an easy to read analysis of why they should invest in Waves and Ice Cream. In this two deliverables, more information was presented about temperature trends before we open the surf shop. Specifically, W. Avy wanted the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Deliverable 1 presented the Summary Statistics for the month of June and deliverable 2 presented the Summary Statistics for the month of December.

## Results:
Summary Statistics for June:

The 3 key differences in weather between June & December:
1. There's a slight difference of 4 degrees in the average temperature. In June the average temperature is about 75 degrees, whereas, in December the average temperature is 71 degrees.
2. The temperature drops much more in December than it does in June. The minimum temperature in December is 56 and the minimum temperature in June is 64.
3. When looking at the 25%, 50%, and 75% quartile for December, it helps understand that it is less likely for the temperature to be towards the max  of 83 degrees in Oahu compared to June.

## Summary:
We can conclude that Oahu, Hawaii would be a good place to open a Wave Ice Cream shop since the temperatures, year round, does not vary drastically. Two additional queries that we may want to perform to gather more weather data for June and December would be precipitation and stations. Gathering information about precipitation is very important because, although temperature isn't changing much throughout the year, but the level of precipitation/rain can be changing throughout th year, which can then impact the shop. Secondly, having enough stations used to collect data is very import. If we don't have enough data collection stations, then our statistical analysis may not be valid.
